There's always been a running joke between people who use Windows as their daily driver OS and those who use Linux:

- **Windows** holds your hand a lot of the time, and there are a lot of protections to stop you running with scissors.
- **Linux** will happily let you run with scissors, enthusiastically gives you them and pulls out its cellphone to film the aftermath.

Joking aside though, the level of control that Linux lets you have over your filesystem, plus the wide array of free and open-source software/tooling available to those brave enough makes exploring Linux both exciting *and* intimidating to newcomers.

The Linux filesystem does **not** look like the Windows setup 99% of people are familiar with growing up, with unfamilar directory names like **/opt/**, **/var/**, **/bin/**, and **/etc/** having no obvious analog to the unfamiliar.

Don't even get me started on the knifefight that'll occur if you're foolish enough to ask "Which distribution should I try first?" on an online forum...

This guide is for the Linux newbie but also the security professional that needs a refresher on the internals of one of the world's most powerful and widespread operating systems. Any penetration tester will be interacting with Linux systems on near every engagement, as it powers 90% of the world's servers.

Suffice to say, the knowledge is **very** useful! 

In this article, we're gonna take a tour of:

- What a distro(distribution) is, 
- What the main distributions are,
- The main directories in the Linux Filesystem,
- A refresher on Linux file permissions
- Interesting places to look on engagements.
