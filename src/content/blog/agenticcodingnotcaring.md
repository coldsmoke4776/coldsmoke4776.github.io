### Introduction

I've been wanting to write here again for a while, but just couldn't find a topic I wanted to talk about enough that didn't feel like it was either:

- Reactionary "Can we stop whining about this shit now?" cynicism,
- Saying something that didn't need to be said because other people already had.

So, rather than trying to kick that off with something polished or ambitious, I figured I’d just say where I’m at right now.

Work has been stressful. <em>Really</em> stressful, if I'm being 100% with you. 

It's that kind of sustained, background stress that slowly drains your energy if you’re not paying attention. The kind that makes even things you <strong>like</strong> start to feel heavy if you’re not careful. That’s been shaping how I build lately more than I realized.

I <em>adored</em> digging into the absolute weeds when I was doing the C roadmap but felt like I'd burnt out a little on being deep in the grass.

Plus, I had some little projects I wanted to try out, and I'd be lying if I said the march of AI coding and the army of people who won't shut the <strong>fuck</strong> about it didn't have a part to play, too.

I figured doing something was better than doing nothing, and I'd always wanted to start playing around with OpenAI's agentic coding assistant, Codex. My Bishop Fox colleague was an early AI adopter and has recommended it for projects for a while, so I spent the last couple of weekends playing around with it. 

Figured I should at least "know my enemy" if this is the thing that's going to drive me out of work (checks notes)...2 years ago? 

Next year?
Tommorow? 
Honestly, I lose track of when I'm meant to become unemployable, these days.

So, I've been using it to build a set of CLI-launched helper tools that I've wanted for a while, in tech stacks I have no intention of diving deep into. 

The feelings have been...interesting, to say the least.
