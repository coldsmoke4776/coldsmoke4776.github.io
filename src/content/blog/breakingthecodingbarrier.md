### Introduction

For years, code felt like a glass wall between what I understood in my head and what I could actually do with my hands.
I could read it, talk about it, explain the concepts — but I couldn’t make it work myself.
I was tired of it.

I’ve been in and around security, architecture, and engineering for over a decade, but writing code always felt like peering through the window at a party I wasn’t invited to. I knew what was happening inside, but I couldn’t quite cross the threshold.

Earlier this year, I decided to do something I’d avoided for far too long: start from scratch and teach myself to code like a systems engineer, not a script writer.

No tutorials, no hand-holding, no frameworks. Just C, a text editor, and a roadmap I wrote myself — a kind of homebrewed computer science degree built out of stubbornness and curiosity. ChatGPT has been an excellent teacher and resource, but this isn't cargo-culted. Being able to brief back how every function worked was a non-negotiable.

I called it the C Proficiency Roadmap, and it’s been equal parts study plan, creative challenge, and masochistic art project.

- Stage 1 was about understanding how data moves.
- Stage 2 was about understanding how memory works.

Three months later, I can confidently say: I broke through the barrier.
Not because I can write C fluently yet — but because I finally understand what’s happening underneath every line I write.
